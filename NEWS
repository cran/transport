	CHANGES IN transport VERSION 0.7-0  (2015-10-21)

OVERVIEW

    o  There are two new ways for computing starting solutions
    in transport.default and transport.pgrid with
    method="revsimplex", which lead to substantial speed
    improvements (mainly in transport.pgrid)
       
    o  Several minor bugfixes

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

    o  transport.pgrid, transport.default
    When method="revsimplex" is chosen, transport.pgrid can now
    start from a solution that is based on the optimal transport
    between two coarsened problems. This "multiscale" behaviour is invoked
    automatically if p>1, the grid is 2-dimensional, of a certain
    minimal size, and has an even number of vertices in each direction
    (for p=1 use the control parameter nscales as in previous
    versions). Both transport.pgrid and transport.default can also
    be started from a solution based on the "Modified Row Minimum
    Rule" (newly implemented in C Code). This is the default
    behaviour now for transport.default, and also for transport.pgrid
    if the multiscale starting solution described above cannot
    be computed.

    To get the behaviour of older versions, say
    control=list(start="nwcorner") in the transport function.

OVERVIEW

    o  Minor changes in the documentation and a bug fix

BUG FIXES

    o  aha
    In the underlying C code integer overflows were possible (usually
    without noticable effects on the result).
    Fixed.
